# SWUTSCH

In the summer semester 2016 the media group project SWUTSCH started, which means "Pub-Crawl" in Hamburg. The project is about a music visualization for the club HALLO WERNER in Augsburg.

The HALLO WERNER is a popular club in the heart of Augsburg, which is known for its Hamburg influenced atmosphere. Based on the identity and the building conditions of the HALLO WERNER, an individual concept was developed: A screen of approximately 2000 pixels to serve as a physical filter for any video material for visuals in the club. In combination with a fog machine in the room and the distorted bright images atmospheric effects and a new worlds arise.

The installation was presented to the public at the event SCHAULEUCHTEN on 07/08/2016.
